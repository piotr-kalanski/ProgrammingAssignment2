## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.

## Creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## - set the value of the matrix
## - get the value of the matrix
## - set the value of the inverse
## - get the value of the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inverse <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inverse <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(i) inverse <<- i
  getinverse <- function() inverse
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function.
## However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated.
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation.
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inverse <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inverse)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inverse)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inverse <- solve(data)
  x$setinverse(inverse)
  inverse
}
